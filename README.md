When first running it you will be prompted to setup your db.props file, this is where you need to set the credentials for the database you will be using. 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) is the default datababase management system used however you can change this in the db.props configuration file by changing the url 
(note that all testing was done on PostgreSQL so no guarantee is made about the stability of using other DBMSs)
